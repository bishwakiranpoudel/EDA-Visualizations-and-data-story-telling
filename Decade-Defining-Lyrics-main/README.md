# Introduction

This analysis delves into the popularity of lyrics over the span of several decades, from the 1940s to the 2020s. By clustering these decades into five distinct groups and creating word clouds to visualize the prevalence of certain words, I aim to uncover trends and shifts in lyrical content over time. The dataset utilized comprises the top 100 Billboard songs from 1946 to 2022.

# Cleaning

To ensure accuracy and relevance, songs with empty lyrics were excluded from the dataset. Additionally, a new set of stop words was curated to filter out common terms that might not contribute substantially to the analysis.
