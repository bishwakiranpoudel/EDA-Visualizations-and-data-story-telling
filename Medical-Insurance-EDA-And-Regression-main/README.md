# Medical Insurance EDA And Regression

In this project, I delved into the realm of medical insurance data, aiming to gain insights into the variables that impact insurance charges. My analysis encompassed a comprehensive examination of various factors such as age, gender, BMI (Body Mass Index), region, and smoking habits, among others. By exploring these variables through descriptive statistics, visualizations, and correlation analyses, I aimed to discern significant associations and elucidate their implications for insurance pricing.
